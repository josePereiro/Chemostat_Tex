By sampling the solution space of E. coli's metabolic network, we show that empirical growth rate distributions recently obtained in experiments at single-cell resolution can be explained in terms of a trade-off between the higher fitness of fast-growing phenotypes and the higher entropy of slow-growing ones. Based on this, we propose a minimal model for the evolution of a large bacterial population that captures this trade-off. The scaling relationships observed in experiments encode, in such frameworks, for the same distance from the maximum achievable growth rate, the same degree of growth rate maximization, and/or the same rate of phenotypic change. Being grounded on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions, these results allow for multiple implications and extensions in spite of the underlying conceptual simplicity.},

Here we quantify the amount of regulation required to control a cell's growth rate by a maximum-entropy approach to the space of underlying metabolic phenotypes, where a configuration corresponds to a metabolic flux pattern as described by genome-scale models. We link the mean growth rate achieved by a population of cells to the minimal amount of metabolic regulation needed to achieve it through a phase diagram that highlights how growth suppression can be as costly (in regulatory terms) as growth enhancement. Moreover, we provide an interpretation of the inverse temperature {$\beta$} controlling maximum-entropy distributions based on the underlying growth dynamics. Specifically, we show that the asymptotic value of {$\beta$} for a cell population can be expected to depend on (i) the carrying capacity of the environment, (ii) the initial size of the colony, and (iii) the probability distribution from which the inoculum was sampled. Results obtained for E. coli and human cells are found to be remarkably consistent with empirical evidence.},

Predictive results have been obtained by flux balance analysis (FBA), by postulating that cells set metabolic fluxes to maximize growth rate. Here we consider a generalization of FBA to single-cell level using maximum entropy modeling, which we extend and test experimentally. Specifically, we define for Escherichia coli metabolism a flux distribution that yields the experimental growth rate: the model, containing FBA as a limit, provides a better match to measured fluxes and it makes a wide range of predictions: on flux variability, regulation, and correlations; on the relative importance of stoichiometry vs. optimization; on scaling relations for growth rate distributions. We validate the latter here with single-cell data at different sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations. The model quantifies growth optimization as emerging from the interplay of competitive dynamics in the population and regulation of metabolism at the level of single cells.},

  abstract = {Mammalian cells have the ability to proliferate under different nutrient environments by utilizing different combinations of the nutrients, especially glucose and the amino acids. Under the conditions often used in in vitro cultivation, the cells consume glucose and amino acids in great excess of what is needed for making up biomass and products. They also produce large amounts of metabolites with lactate, ammonia, and some non-essential amino acids such as alanine as the most dominant ones. By controling glucose and glutamine at low levels, cellular metabolism can be altered and can result in reduced glucose and glutamine consumption as well as in reduced metabolite formation. Using a fed-batch reactor to manipulate glucose at a low level (as compared to a typical batch culture), cell metabolism was altered to a state with substantially reduced lactate production. The culture was then switched to a continuous mode and allowed to reach a steady-state. At this steady-state, the concentrations of cells and antibody were substantially higher than a control culture that was initiated from a batch culture without first altering cellular metabolism. The lactate and other metabolite concentrations were also substantially reduced as compared to the control culture. This newly observed steady-state was achieved at the same dilution rate and feed medium as the control culture. The paths leading to the two steady-states, however, were different. These results demonstrate steady-state multiplicity. At this new steady-state, not only was glucose metabolism altered, but the metabolism of amino acids was altered as well. The amino acid metabolism in the new steady-state was more balanced, and the excretion of non-essential amino acids and ammonia was substantially lower. This approach of reaching a more desirable steady-state with higher concentrations of cells and product opens a new avenue for high-density- and high-productivity-cell culture. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Here we show that population bimodality can emerge even when biological processes are homogenous at the cell level and the environment is kept constant. Our model is based on the stochastic partitioning of a cell component with an optimal copy number. We show that the existence of unimodal or bimodal distributions depends on the variance of partition errors and the growth rate tolerance around the optimal copy number. In particular, our theory provides a consistent explanation for the maintenance of aneuploid states in a population. The proposed model can also be relevant for other cell components such as mitochondria and plasmids, whose abundances affect the growth rate and are subject to stochastic partition at cell division.},

We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. More importantly, we derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. First, that the ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties invariant across perfusion systems. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by the negative feedback loop on cell growth due to toxic byproduct accumulation. Moreover, a complex landscape of steady states in continuous cell culture emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced. Thus, in order to actually reflect the expected behavior in perfusion, performance benchmarks of cell-lines and culture media should be carried out in a chemostat.},

Metabolic flux analysis conducted using metabolite and gas exchange rate measurements revealed a more efficient culture for the steady state with the higher cell concentration, as measured by the fraction of pyruvate carbon flux shuttled into the TCA cycle for energy generation. The low-efficiency steady state was achieved after innoculation by growing the cells in a nutrient rich environment, first in batch mode followed by a stepwise increase of the dilution rate to its set point at 0.04 h-1. The high-efficiency steady state was achieved by reducing the dilution rate to progressively lower values to 0.01 h-1 resulting in conditions of stricter nutrient limitation. The high energetic efficiency attained under such conditions was preserved upon increasing the chemostat dilution rate back to 0.04 h-1 with a higher nutrient consumption, resulting in approximate doubling of the steady state cell concentration. This metabolic adaptation is unlikely due to favorable genetic mutations and could be implemented for improving cell culture performance by inducing cellular metabolic shifts to more efficient flux distribution patterns. \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {Hybridoma cells were cultivated in a chemically defined medium in continuous cultures. These cultures reached different steady states marked by distinctive cell metabolism depending on the culture conditions leading to the steady state. Those steady states with different metabolism are characterized by different stoichiometric ratios of lactate production to glucose consumption ({$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G). The specific consumption rates of glucose, glutamine and other amino acids are reduced when {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G reduces. Those steady states do not have a few discrete values of {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}Gs, rather they span from a high {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G state ({$>$} 1.0) to an intermediate state (0.1 {$\leq$} {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G {$\leq$} 1.0), and reduces even further at a low {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G state ({$<$} 0.1). Metabolic flux analysis was performed to compare energy metabolism of cells in cultures representing these three distinct metabolic states. The material balance on carbon and nitrogen was facilitated by the use of chemically defined medium. The formation of biomass was systematically estimated. It was revealed that all glycolysis and TCA cycle fluxes are reduced as {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G decreases. At the low {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G state, a reduction in amino acid specific consumption rate is accompanied by a reduction in all the fluxes around pyruvate. The analysis also shows that the outflux from the TCA cycle to form pyruvate, which contributes to lactate formation, is possibly linked to the higher consumption rate of amino acids at the high {$\Delta$}L{$\Delta$}G state. Taken together the results suggest the amino acid metabolism plays an important role in reducing lactate production in mammalian cell culture.},

Even symmetrically dividing cells can then by chance produce daughters with very different composition. The size of the errors depends on the segregation mechanism: Control systems can reduce low-abundance errors, but the segregation process can also be subject to upstream sources of randomness or spatial heterogeneities that create large errors despite high abundances. Here we mathematically demonstrate how partitioning errors arise for different types of segregation mechanisms and how errors can be greatly increased by upstream heterogeneity but remarkably hard to avoid through controlled partitioning. We also show that seemingly straightforward experiments cannot be straightforwardly interpreted because very different mechanisms produce identical fits and present an approach to deal with this problem by adding binomial counting noise and testing for convexity or concavity in the partitioning error as a function of the binomial thinning parameter. The results lay a conceptual groundwork for more effective studies of heterogeneity among growing and dividing cells, whether in microbes or in differentiating tissues.},

If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between 'probability theory' and 'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary.},

  abstract = {In the hierarchy of data, information and knowledge, computational methods play a major role in the initial processing of data to extract information, but they alone become less effective to compile knowledge from information. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) resource (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) has been developed as a reference knowledge base to assist this latter process. In particular, the KEGG pathway maps are widely used for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. The link from genomes to pathways is made through the KEGG Orthology system, a collection of manually defined ortholog groups identified by K numbers. To better automate this interpretation process the KEGG modules defined by Boolean expressions of K numbers have been expanded and improved. Once genes in a genome are annotated with K numbers, the KEGG modules can be computationally evaluated revealing metabolic capacities and other phenotypic features. The reaction modules, which represent chemical units of reactions, have been used to analyze design principles of metabolic networks and also to improve the definition of K numbers and associated annotations. For translational bioinformatics, the KEGG MEDICUS resource has been developed by integrating drug labels (package inserts) used in society.},

  abstract = {Cultured mammalian cells exhibit elevated glycolysis flux and high lactate production. In the industrial bioprocesses for biotherapeutic protein production, glucose is supplemented to the culture medium to sustain continued cell growth resulting in the accumulation of lactate to high levels. In such fed-batch cultures, sometimes a metabolic shift from a state of high glycolysis flux and high lactate production to a state of low glycolysis flux and low lactate production or even lactate consumption is observed. While in other cases with very similar culture conditions, the same cell line and medium, cells continue to produce lactate. A metabolic shift to lactate consumption has been correlated to the productivity of the process. Cultures that exhibited the metabolic shift to lactate consumption had higher titers than those which didn't. However, the cues that trigger the metabolic shift to lactate consumption state (or low lactate production state) are yet to be identified. Metabolic control of cells is tightly linked to growth control through signaling pathways such as the AKT pathway. We have previously shown that the glycolysis of proliferating cells can exhibit bistability with well-segregated high flux and low flux states. Low lactate production (or lactate consumption) is possible only at a low glycolysis flux state. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to demonstrate that lactate inhibition together with AKT regulation on glycolysis enzymes can profoundly influence the bistable behavior, resulting in a complex steady-state topology. The transition from the high flux state to the low flux state can only occur in certain regions of the steady state topology, and therefore the metabolic fate of the cells depends on their metabolic trajectory encountering the region that allows such a metabolic state switch. Insights from such switch behavior present us with new means to control the metabolism of mammalian cells in fed-batch cultures.},

  abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63\% of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11\% of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-{$\beta$}. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-{$\beta$} activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-{$\beta$} pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM.},

  abstract = {Mammalian cell cultures are the most appropriate host cells for recombinant DNA derived products if complex protein structures have to be synthesized in their native form. Due to their physiological behaviour they grow either adherent or in suspension. For the attachment of adherent cells, microcarriers or wire springs can be applied to increase the internal surface of the bioreactor. Both systems provide a simplified media exchange but, however, show some limitations in scale up. In contrast, suspension culture systems as homogeneous systems independent of any carrier have not shown any limitation in scale up. Because most cell lines which are of commercial interest grow in suspension, this technology is best advanced and used in batch and continuous mode. Although mammalian cell cultures are sensitive to hydrodynamic shear forces, technologies for deep tank production are developed which allow stirrer tip speed of up to 1.5 m s-1 sufficient for oxygen uptake, suspension of cells and homogeneous supply with nutrients. For long term bioprocesses without selection pressure it has to be considered that transformed cell lines might show genetic instability due to their variations of chromosomes. In addition, sterile technology becomes an important factor in long term bioprocesses. The decision as to which cell culture system should be chosen, whether batch or continuous processes should be applied essentially is based on the capital investment, the amount of material to be produced, genetic stability of the production cell line, reliability of sterile technology and the flexibility required in the production plant. Under the assumption that 20 kg of a protein have to be produced per year and the same product concentrations in the harvest fluid are reached in the batch process and for instance in the chemostat, it can be considered that the capital investment for one 10,000 l batch process and a 2 x 2,000 l continuous process, necessary to produce the amount of material, is comparable. Risk of microbial contamination or technical failure can be considered to be fairly low in the batch process. The economic risk for long term bioprocess in the chemostat can be expected to be medium and high in the perfusion system which is in the large scale not technically fully satisfactory. In addition, due to the longer down time period after contaminations and the start up of the continuous process, the annual yield of the batch process can be considered to be higher.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},
