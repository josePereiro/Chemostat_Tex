	\subsubsection{CHO}
	
	Chinese hamster ovary ($CHO$) host cell-lines GEM was obtained from \shortcite{Hefzi2016a} and was set up in \shortcite{Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz2018b}.  The external metabolite concentrations were set to the values indicated in $Table\ 1-2$, similar to Recon3D. Also, a few extra metabolites, taken from \shortcite{Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz2018b} were included in the feed medium. An important difference from Recon3D was that $CHO$ is able to grow without pe\_hs[e], named in $CHO$ as pe\_cho\_e.
