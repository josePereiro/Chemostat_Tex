\subsubsection{Biomass equation}

	Recon3DModel\_301.mat was downloaded from http://vmh.life [2], the biomass equation was modified to ajust the biomass demand reported by [1] for the cell line AGE1\_HN. All the others original demands from recon3d were desactivated. An extra demand representing the maintinance demand of atp was set acording to [5]. All the fluxes representing exchangeble metabolites (external reactions) were set as reversible (lb and ub set to a big number), so the only efective constraints (for FBA and EP) was the one produced by the chemostat consideration[4]. \\n The external metabolites present in the feeding medium was set acording 42\_MAX\_UB medium [6] for each of the 6 continuos cultivatios conditions. A set of extra external metabolites, not specified in the medium, was also added. Particulary Recon3d was unable to growth without pe\_hs[e] (or similar) lipid in the feeding medium. Later we will discuse the impact of this metabolite in the medium.
