	\subsection{Preparing GEMs} 
	
	\subsubsection{Human}
	For modeling the metabolism of the human derived cell AGE1.HN.AA1, it was used a $GEM$ from \shortcite{shlomi_genome-scale_2011}(download link: $??$). The GEM biomass equation was modified in agreement with the  biomass composition for AGE1.HN.AA1 reported in \shortcite{niklas_metabolism_2013}. The production of $\alpha$1-antitrypsin ($A1AT$) was also considered, it was used the protein sequence, $https://www.drugbank.ca/polypeptides/P01009$, and the reported production rate for $A1AT$ \shortcite{rath_characterisation_2017} to set a maintenance for the required amino acids. Additionally, an atp demand ($ATPM$) was included, taking the maintenance energy demand for mammalian cells reported in  \shortcite{fernandez-de-cossio-diaz_physical_2018}.
	
	\subsubsection{E. coli}
	With the same propose of modeling the cellular metabolism, the $E. coli$ $GEM$ iJR904 \shortcite{reed_expanded_2003} (download link: $https://darwin.di.uminho.pt/models$) was modified to match with \shortcite{van_heerden_continuous_2013} data. The reported genetic modifications for the Escherichia coli KJ13 strain were included. It was also added enzymatic cost constraints in concordance with \shortcite{beg_intracellular_2007}.
